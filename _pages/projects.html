   <h4 class="page-title">Screenshots available on my Github</h3>
   <p>I've started to add screenshots and additional content on <a href="https://github.com/briandev246/iOS-portfolio">my Github repository showing my portfolio of recent iOS Swift projects.<a></p>
</header>

<p>Below is brief description of a few basic apps to show proficiency with Swift language, iOS frameworks, and the concepts underlying iOS development.</p>


<div class="projects">
  <div class="grid no-gutters">

    <div class="unit one-third">
      <div class="project">
        <h4 class="project-title">MovieTracker App</h4>
        <p>Utilized UIKit APIs <b>new to iOS13 (compositional layout and diffable datasource)</b> to enable orthogonal scrolling (Netflix-style UI with rows in a UICollectionView, with each row's content scrollable left-to-right).
        <p>The user is able to browse featured movies (popular, in theaters now, upcoming) and to search the full dataset of movies. User is also able to create and maintain their personal Watchlist of movies.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="unit one-third">
      <div class="project">
        <h4 class="project-title">MyTesla App</h4>
        <p>Created app using unofficial Tesla <b>REST API</b> to enable user stories beyond Tesla's supported app.
        <p>Implemented <b>SiriKit</b> functionality new in iOS 12 to allow user to use Siri to retrieve vehicle status and issue vehicle commands in the background, without having to open up the app.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="unit one-third">
      <div class="project">
        <h4 class="project-title">Weather App</h4>
        <p>I wanted to create a simple app retrieving JSON data from a REST API in order to display it in UITableView, so I made a weather app.
        <p>Utilized <b>Core Location</b> and <b>MapKit</b> frameworks, as well as UISearchController for filtering.
      </div>

  <div class="grid no-gutters">
    <div class="unit one-third">
      <div class="project">
        <h4 class="project-title">JSONPlaceholder Apps</h4>
        <p>Building upon the idea underlying the weather app, I wanted to generalize for any JSON data and also for UICollectionView in addition to UITableView. I found the <a target="_blank" rel="external" href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com">JSONPlaceholder API</a> to be perfect for this.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="unit one-third">
      <div class="project">
        <h4 class="project-title">Alarm/Reminders App</h4>
        <p>Created a basic alarm/reminders app utilizing the <b>UserNotifications</b> framework. User can provide text and optional image to be displayed, and can respond directly in the notification via custom actions.</p>

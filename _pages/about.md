<div class="lead lead-about">Hi, I'm Brian and I'm an iOS Engineer.
</div>

Because my background is somewhat atypical, I wrote this section below to provide more context and put a link on my resume to this page.

The quick version is:
- I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in CS with honors
- worked in both the US and China
- changed careers into finance via the challenging CFA program
- realized I find tech much more interesting and moved back to the US in order to focus on [iOS development and Swift](/projects/).

If you would like more detail, additional background is provided below.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you!

## CS Degree and worked in the US

I grew up in California and was fortunate to have the opportunity to attend UC Irvine on full merit-based scholarship with an excellent Computer Science program. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with honors and then subsequently worked in the US in software engineer roles.

## China

While working in the US for an Irvine-based software and solutions company that was aggressively expanding worldwide, I was offered the opportunity to relocate overseas to Shanghai to help establish their China presence to serve as their Asia headquarters.

During that time in China, I also studied Mandarin Chinese as a non-native speaker and have reached intermediate level (approximately 2500 characters, HSK5 proficiency).

While living overseas I also travelled extensively (~40 countries) in Asia, Europe, and South America.

## Finance via the rigorous CFA program

I've always been interested in both tech and investing, and to that end I changed careers into finance by doing the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) program â€“ a challenging, rigorous worldwide program that only ~10% of the initial participants finish.

I was drawn to the program because of its impeccable reputation and that it is considered to be wider in scope and more in-depth than either an MBA or a masters in finance.

## Back to the US as an iOS Engineer

After moving over to finance, ultimately I realized that I found tech to be much more interesting and compelling, and that the best place in the world to be in tech is back home in the US.

To that end, I decided to leave China and have moved back to the US for full-time employment as a **software engineer focused on iOS development and Swift**.
